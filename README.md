# therapyBot

This application uses Cellular Automata rules and IBM Watson's tone analyzer to analyzer text the user inputs and glitch the rgb channels from the users webcam according to various Cellular Automata rules. For example if the user inputs negative emotions this will result in a response from the virtual therapist and will initiate a CA glitch that causes their image to deteriorate while positive emotions will initilize a CA effect that restores the users image.
